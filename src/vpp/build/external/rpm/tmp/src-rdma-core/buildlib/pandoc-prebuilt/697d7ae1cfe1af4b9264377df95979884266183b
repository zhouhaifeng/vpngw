ibv_import_device \- import a device from a given command FD
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <infiniband/verbs.h>

struct ibv_context *ibv_import_device(int cmd_fd);
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ibv_import_device()\f[R] returns an \f[I]ibv_context\f[R] pointer
that is associated with the given \f[I]cmd_fd\f[R].
.PP
The \f[I]cmd_fd\f[R] is obtained from the ibv_context cmd_fd member,
which must be dup\[cq]d (eg by dup(), SCM_RIGHTS, etc) before being
passed to ibv_import_device().
.PP
Once the \f[I]ibv_context\f[R] usage has been ended
\f[I]ibv_close_device()\f[R] should be called.
This call may cleanup whatever is needed/opposite of the import
including closing the command FD.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\f[B]ibv_import_device()\f[R] returns a pointer to the allocated RDMA
context, or NULL if the request fails.
.SH SEE ALSO
