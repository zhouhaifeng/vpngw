efadv \- Direct verbs for efa devices
.PP
This provides low level access to efa devices to perform direct
operations, without general branching performed by libibverbs.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The libibverbs API is an abstract one.
It is agnostic to any underlying provider specific implementation.
While this abstraction has the advantage of user applications
portability, it has a performance penalty.
For some applications optimizing performance is more important than
portability.
.PP
The efa direct verbs API is intended for such applications.
It exposes efa specific low level operations, allowing the application
to bypass the libibverbs API.
.PP
The direct include of efadv.h together with linkage to efa library will
allow usage of this new interface.
