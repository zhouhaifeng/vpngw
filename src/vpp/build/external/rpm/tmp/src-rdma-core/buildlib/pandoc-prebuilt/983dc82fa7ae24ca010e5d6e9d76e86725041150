.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]ibv_req_notify_cq()\f[R] requests a completion notification on the
completion queue (CQ) \f[I]cq\f[R].

Upon the addition of a new CQ entry (CQE) to \f[I]cq\f[R], a completion
event will be added to the completion channel associated with the CQ.
If the argument \f[I]solicited_only\f[R] is zero, a completion event is
generated for any new CQE.
If \f[I]solicited_only\f[R] is non\-zero, an event is only generated for
a new CQE with that is considered \[lq]solicited.\[rq] A CQE is
solicited if it is a receive completion for a message with the Solicited
Event header bit set, or if the status is not successful.
All other successful receive completions, or any successful send
completion is unsolicited.

errno on failure (which indicates the failure reason).
